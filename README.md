# Improving-Potato-Disease-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-Feature-Fusion
This project leverages CNNs with feature fusion (Early, Intermediate, Late) to classify potato leaf diseases (Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy). The Late Fusion method achieved the highest accuracy on a 2,152-image dataset, improving disease detection for agriculture.
